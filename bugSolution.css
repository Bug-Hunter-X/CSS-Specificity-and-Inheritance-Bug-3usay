The solution involves carefully restructuring selectors to correctly address specificity issues.  One approach would be to be more explicit about the style hierarchy:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.red {
  color: red;
}

p {
  color: green;
}

.red p {
  color: yellow; 
}

.red div p {
  color: purple !important;
}
```

Using `!important` is generally discouraged for maintainability but can be helpful here to explicitly override cascading issues. Alternatively, restructure selectors and properties to ensure the correct specificity applies in the CSS cascade.
